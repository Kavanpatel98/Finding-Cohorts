# Finding-Cohorts

Finding Cohorts is a research project undertaken at **AUT** and sponsored by **Orion Health**. This research is performend on two researching dataset, which are **Cohort selection for clinical trials: n2c2 2018 and MIMIC-III**.

Befor reviewing sample code, it is essitional to read research report (**Research Report.pdf**) because it will provide you an clear understanding of research gap and its objective; alongside it will also provide a clear pathway to methodology that are used in this python files. 

There are 4 python files which are used to achieve 3 objective of this research. Following is detail of each python file and objective:

**Objective 1: Build a machine learning model that can predict whether the patient has meet with an selected criteria or not - Criteria Prediction.ipynb**

**Objective 2: Build a machine learning model that can visualize cohorts based on patients - (Date Extraction Function.ipynb and Cohort Visualisation Based on Patients.ipnb)**

**Objective 3: Provide an example of Impact Analysis and identify that if it can be used in Smart Cohort or not? - (Impact Analysis Example.ipynb)**
